- 👋 Hi, I’m Akorede. I’m interested in building next-generation software engineering products powered by Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence in various platforms - in the browser, smartphones and on tiny embedded sensors using tools like TensorFlow, TensorFlow JS, and Node Js.


- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing with TensorFlow and Pytorch and in deploying them to various environments as mentioned above.
